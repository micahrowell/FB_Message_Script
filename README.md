# FB_Message_Script
Replaces downloaded FB messages with appropriate file names.

Take the file script.py and place it in the directory where your facebook messages are.

When you run the script, give it an argument of the number of files you want to convert. For instance, if your files are labeled 0 - 100 and you want to label them all, give the argument 100.
